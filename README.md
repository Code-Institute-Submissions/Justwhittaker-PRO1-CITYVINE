City Vine Ireland

The idea for city vine is based on my experience within the hospitlaity industry and the
fact that there is a lack of exposure for good wines and education on wine tasting to a younger 
generation.

I have discussed this idea with afew wine distributers and they are keen to get involved 
as the Irish nation are predominently Beer drinkers and wine is normally seen as an 
accompliment to a meal instead of just a casual drinking experience.

Bringing afew restaurants on board allows them to be seen as a great food venue but also a space for 
entertaining and enjoying the company of friends and family.

UX

For the UX on this project I wanted to create a simple and user friendly site.
My target audience is between 18-39years old. Hence I chose vibarant colors, many visual aids 
such as videos, pictures and ensured that my social links are large and clickable.

I added plenty of href links to allow the user to find out more infomation and navigate the 
site with ease. I was very careful to ensure that any external links are opened in a seperate 
tab so that the user doesn't fully leave my site and can quickly return without forgetting how they got there.

With this website I would like to acheieve higher pre event ticket sales, giving the user many various
methods in arriving to the signup menu, buttons and nav links ensure that the user is very aware that 
tickets are available and easy to buy for friends too.
With more pre-sales it allows the company to better estimate the total people that are coming,
bringing in early revenue allowing for less intitial capital expediture at the begining of the events.
Also it allows the company to liase correctly with the Wineries and distributers to ensure that they 
bring enough stock for the number of guests coming. 

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users buy tickets to the events , by having them fill out the signup form. (signup.html)

Additional Features in the future include:
Feature 5 - gallery page dedicated to pictures taken by guests and professional photographers allowing people to use 
            our socail platforms more often creating more engagement and thus more traffic on google anatlytics
Feature 6 - Competition Modual to win a prizr of a case of the "wine of the Month"

Technologies Used
    1. HTML
    2. CSS
    3 Wireframe was done on Balsamiq
        href ="https://balsamiq.cloud/s6vjh9d/pktgf7d" 
    4. Used mostly the Code Institute liberies rewatched a fwe videos
    5. Google searches to add video content and do basic input adjustments to my form file.
    6. No JQuery used

Sign-up form:
"SignUp" page
1. Submitted an empty form and verified that an error message about the required fields appears
2. Submitted an an invalid email address and verified that a relevant error message appears
3. Submitted the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

Brower interchange
<!--In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

Debug, Testing & Issues
1. I found it difficult to ensure that the text-decoration was removed from the wineries web references on the wines page
        it also took me awhile to figure out the gallery method to ensure a good flow to the veiw.

2. Debug issues found
     File "/tmp/vscode-extensions/ms-python.python@2019.11.50794/extension/pythonFiles/lib/python/new_ptvsd/wheels/ptvsd/../ptvsd/server/cli.py", line 204, in run_file

Deployment
<!--This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
