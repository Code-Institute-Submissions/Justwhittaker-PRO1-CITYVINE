Milestone Project html/css
City Vine Ireland

The idea for city vine is based on my experience within the hospitlaity industry and the
fact that there is a lack of exposure for good wines and education on wine tasting to a younger 
generation.

I have discussed this idea with afew wine distributers and they are keen to get involved 
as the Irish nation are predominently Beer drinkers and wine is normally seen as an 
accompliment to a meal instead of just a casual drinking experience.

Bringing afew restaurants on board allows them to be seen as a great food venue but also a space for 
entertaining and enjoying the company of friends and family.

UX

For the UX on this project I wanted to create a simple and user friendly site.
My target audience is between 18-39years old. Hence I chose vibarant colors, many visual aids 
such as videos, pictures and ensured that my social links are large and clickable.

I added plenty of href links to allow the user to find out more infomation and navigate the 
site with ease. I was very careful to ensure that any external links are opened in a seperate 
tab so that the user doesn't fully leave my site and can quickly return without forgetting how they got there.

With this website I would like to acheieve higher pre event ticket sales, giving the user many various
methods in arriving to the signup menu, buttons and nav links ensure that the user is very aware that 
tickets are available and easy to buy for friends too.
With more pre-sales it allows the company to better estimate the total people that are coming,
bringing in early revenue allowing for less intitial capital expediture at the begining of the events.
Also it allows the company to liase correctly with the Wineries and distributers to ensure that they 
bring enough stock for the number of guests coming. 

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
